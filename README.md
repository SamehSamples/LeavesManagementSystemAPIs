# Sample 1: Employee Leaves Management System APIs
This is a sample project that focuses on building a backend APIs application using Laravel framework.

The application is an implementation of Kuwaiti Labor law in the part related to employee leaves, explained below (the application business logic).

The application is developed using Repository Pattern to separate the business logic and data access logic and locate them into repositories and to keep code as dry as possible.

The application mainly 	allows employees to check their different leave types balances, apply for different leave types, and allow their direct managers to accept or reject these leaves.

The application also has some basic functionality like: user registration, login, reset password, etc.

It is hosted in AWS EC2 instance, connected to a AWS RDS MySQL database, and utilizing some other AWS services like S3 and SQS.

## What is Leave Management System?
It is an application that allows organization employees to check their leave balances and apply for leaves in self-service manner. It also allows direct managers to approve/reject their direct subordinates leave applications.  
It is built around the employee leaves as per the Kuwaiti Labor Law, featuring all its leave types.  
The system has the following types of users:
* Individual admins (no employee associated).
* Employees with self-service enabled with admin status.
* Employees with self-service enabled with no admin status.
* Employees with self-service disabled.

Some employees might have records but no self-services accounts (employees who are ICT illiterate), system admins can apply for leaves on behalf of such employees and then the processes will continue normally from there.  
Only Employeeâ€™s direct manager can action (approve/reject) their direct subordinates leave applications.  
All Leave related transactions are logged and all Employee related transactions are logged.
## What are the Leave types?

### Leaves Entity
To be able to properly describe all type of leaves as per the Kuwaiti Labor Law, the *leaves* table was designed as follows:

| id |leave id in system|
|name|leave name|
|pay_percentage| the percentage of leave paid salary as per its type|
|default_block_duration_in_days|the leave length in days per the leave's calculation period|
|calculation_period|the period (number of days) in which the leave block is granted. for example: 365 (annually) or null (per service period)|
|allowed_blocks_per_period|number of allowed leave block per period. for example: 3 blocks of Maternity Leaves are allowed during service period|
|days_allowed_after|the number of days of employee service after which the leave is allowed for the employee|

|dividable| should the leave block duration consumed all at once or it could be consumed in parts|
|balance_is_accumulated|could the leave balance be accumulated from one *calculation_period* to another|
